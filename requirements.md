## IN - What will your product do
Describe the individual features that your product will do.
High overview of each. Only need to list 4-5
Example:
- User will be prompted with 5 dinosaurs pictures and a button that says start test
- When the user is ready they can click the button to start memory test
- After clicking button, the user will be shown 20 dinosaurs and be prompted to click on the 5 they were shown earlier for the memory test
- Users will be able to choose the difficulty of the memory test
- At the end users will be given an option to look at Dinosaur Encyclopedia


## OUT - What will your product not do.
These should be features that you will make very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development. These should be limited and very few. Pick your battles wisely. This should only be 1 or 2 things. Example: My website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.
