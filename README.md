# DinoRiders
Gerald Bruno, Jeffery Flores, Wasim Soomro, ChristianRhey Tojot 

In this project we are creating a children's game that will assess their memory and knowledge of dinosaurs. We will display one page with dinosaur images and a second page where they will have to identify which dinosaurs they saw on the first page.
